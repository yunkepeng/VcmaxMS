
## Leaf traits database

## Comprehensive leaf traits dataset. This dataset provided a more updated version than Peng et al. 2021 Communications Biology, basing on more recent publications and information, and after more recent data cleaning and updates. All public available, while it should be contacted with Yunke Peng (yunke.peng@usys.ethz.ch) before any publication use to make sure that it follows relevant data use policy for citations. Furthermore, comparing with the version uploaded here, we have now prepared a larger database by expanding more samples (e.g. samples not constrained by leaf N or P) - this expanded version was NOT uploaded here, but could be contacted with Yunke Peng upon further data request.

###### Data availbility: The individuals data are available from the authors of papers (see citation information from the method part of paper). In case of any issues concerning the observed and predicted data, and for all queries on ancillary information including the climate data, please contact Yunke Peng (yunke.peng@usys.ethz.ch) or Iain Colin Prentice (c.prentice@imperial.ac.uk).


#####For laef_traits.csv, it has included following measured variables for all individuals data:

* lat: latitude in degree
* lon: lontitude in degree
* Elevation: Elevation in m
* Vcmax.25: Measured maximum rate of carboxylation capacity at 25 degree (umol/m2/s)
* Vcmax.tleaf: Measured maximum rate of carboxylation capacity at leaf temperature (umol/m2/s)
* Jmax.25: Measured maximum rate of electron transport at 25 degree (umol/m2/s)
* Jmax.tleaf: Measured maximum rate of electron transport at leaf temperature (umol/m2/s)
* narea: leaf nitrogen per area (g/m2)
* parea: leaf phosphrous per area (g/m2)
* Aarea: saturated A assimilations (Asat)
* lma: leaf mass per area (g/m2) 
* Year: measurement year
* species: genus species
* Tleaf: Measured leaf temperature
* Ca_Global: CO2 concentration (in ppm) at measurement year
* PPFD: Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (umol/m2/s) calculated from SW_down from WFDEI
* vpd: vapor-pressure-deficient (kPa) calculated from tmx, tmn and qair
* Tg: growth temperature calculated from tmx and tmn
* soil_pH (collected from measured soil data from Jon Lloyd and Thomas Domingues): soil pH
* soil_CN (collected from measured soil data from Jon Lloyd and Thomas Domingues): soil C/N 
* Soil_P_total (collected from measured soil data from Jon Lloyd and Thomas Domingues): total soil P (mg/kg)
